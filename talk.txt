the homepage is the index.js
note in the component section you need to put .tsx 
apparently global css isnt available in the index( it is )
to make the icons fit i entered some text in the _app.tsx file from font awesome


<div className="hp-btn">
            <a href="#" className="flexbx-1-btn">
              Explore events
            </a>
            <a href="#" className="flexbx-1-btn2">
              Learn more
            </a>
          </div>

           <ErrorMessage errors={errors} name="enterEvent" />

           <form onSubmit={handleSubmit(onSubmit)}>
      <input
        {...register("multipleErrorInput", {
          required: "This is required.",
          pattern: {
            value: /d+/,
            message: "This input is number only."
          },
          maxLength: {
            value: 10,
            message: "This input exceed maxLength."
          }
        })}
      />
.next/static/

this most be added to the live github file to make it work 

basePath: "/hostout-frontend-tsx-",
  assetPrefix:"/hostout-frontend-tsx-",

  to make the background image work write the path name in this format 

  background: url('/the page name /the file name ')
   for this to work it has to be in the home directory
